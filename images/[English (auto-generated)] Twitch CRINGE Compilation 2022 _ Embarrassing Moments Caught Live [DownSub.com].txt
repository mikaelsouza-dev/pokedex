he says the one who just got [ __ ]

i haven't gotten rejected yet

you definitely have you literally just

did on this live reject him again i

didn't even want her girl i didn't even

want her who asked if she wants you and

[Music]

now you're just putting words in my

mouth bro

um okay you know what

i'm not gonna waste any more breath on

you you're obviously unloyal and your

dude needs to get some hoes

dude she just rejected me

stupid tell you tell your boyfriend to

shut up

why is your tongue blue were you sucking

off a smurf like what the [ __ ] up with

the head oh why is your tongue

thing called blue waffles

i am a wanted man i can't return back

home

i was living in hawaii making an

incredible amount of money

for doing very little work with the

woman that i i loved

and i i had to give all of that up and

so you know again in the context of this

um this idea of whistleblowing it's

really remarkable to me

uh

that

people go through the day

and they become so

familiar

with this sense of wrongdoing with

seeing things like i saw in the office

and hoping somebody else would do

something about our returning blind eye

going it's not my problem these are not

my people it doesn't impact me you know

i can get by with it that they just let

things happen

um

but i don't want to do that anymore

and so it's

really astonishing to me that

just before i connected i had a

friend reach out to me

and tell me they heard things on this

conference

uh like is someone saying that they

couldn't afford this

you know the host uh saying find it

uh but we can't accept that people are

struggling

and there are things that we can't ask

them to do

and to say that that's okay to turnabout

to go on with that i think is wrong

and so i have to ask

it's very unusual that you booked me for

this conference because you know as a

whistleblower it's my obligation i think

personally and professionally to ask uh

is this you

yes

because i think that it is yes and i

think that the things that i've heard

tonight make me very uncomfortable with

this event i think it makes me very

uncomfortable and everyone involved with

this should really question

is this the kind of association that

they want to have are you going to be

able to deliver on the promises that

you're making them i sure hope to god

that you will but my advice to everyone

on this call tonight everyone looking at

this

is look up uh what you're getting

involved in if you spend money

are you sure that you want to spend it

or do you want to charge it back

um

and by god think hard about if you want

to continue this because for me ladies

and gentlemen for tonight

i don't

thank you so much and good night

wow

let's uh let's take like few minutes

break and i'll write i'll be right back

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

you
